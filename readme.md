# Regression Analysis in Excel

## Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing customer spending behavior for The Trendy Shopper, a fast-growing e-commerce company. Using regression analysis, the goal was to uncover the influence of key factors like product price and discounts on total spending, enabling the company to optimize its pricing and marketing strategies.

## Objective
The main objective was to analyze transactional data to:
- Determine the relationship between discounts and total customer spending.
- Build predictive models using simple and multiple regression to quantify the impact of different factors on spending.
- Provide actionable insights for pricing and promotional strategies.

## Problem Statement
The Trendy Shopper faced challenges in understanding how discounts and product prices influenced customer spending. A lack of insight into these factors hindered the ability to develop targeted pricing strategies, leaving the company reliant on a one-size-fits-all approach.

## What Was Done
The project was divided into five tasks:

### 1. Correlation Analysis
- Examined the relationship between discounts and total spending.
- Visualized the data using scatter plots and computed correlation coefficients.

### 2. Simple Linear Regression
- Built a regression model to quantify the impact of discounts on spending.
- Interpreted the slope, intercept, and fit of the model to determine how discounts influence customer behavior.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
- Incorporated product price alongside discounts in the regression model.
- Cleaned the data, analyzed distributions, and addressed skewness using transformations.
- Evaluated model performance before and after transformation by analyzing residuals and R-squared values.

### 4. Advanced Regression Analysis
- Included additional variables like age, gender, region, and product category.
- Created dummy variables for categorical data and checked for multicollinearity using VIF.
- Assessed model performance with R-squared, F-statistics, and p-values.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Used the regression model to predict customer spending on a testing dataset.
- Compared predicted values with actual values and assessed model accuracy.

## Key Insights
- Discounts significantly influenced customer spending, but their impact varied depending on product price and other factors.
- Transforming skewed variables improved model fit, highlighting the importance of addressing data distribution issues.
- Regional and demographic factors played a role in spending behavior, suggesting the need for localized strategies.

## Conclusions
This analysis provided critical insights into how pricing and discounts drive customer spending. The predictive models serve as a foundation for The Trendy Shopper to develop targeted pricing strategies, improving profitability and customer satisfaction. Future work should explore additional variables and advanced machine learning techniques for even more accurate predictions.
